Golang microservice for my professional resume

This is a simple web application to take my resume maintained in Markdown and turn it into a nice HTML page to display. You can see it at [jameslind.info](http://jameslind.info). It also includes a LaTeX script to turn the Markdown resume into a nice pdf, though this still needs to be done through the command line currently.
